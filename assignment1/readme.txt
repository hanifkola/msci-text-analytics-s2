Hi Gaurav

I hope you are doing well and thank you for the last week torurial, I riterally re-wrote the code of  this assignment after that toruarial. 
I made a single python code which read files, combines them, remove stop words, devide lines randomly for train, test and validate sets and write them in 8 csv files. I wrote the name of files in captions of the code. since some of the output files were bigger than 25Mb limit, I uploaded in zip format. Also I tried to use "git lf's" but I don't know why it doesn't work well for me. I think it is because  I am working on win 32 OS, I have some problems installing Git apps on my computer. I am working on it and fix it for my next assignment for sure.

Cheers
Hanif
