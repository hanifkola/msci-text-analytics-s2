Hi Gaurav

I hope you are doing well and thank you for the last week tutorial, I literally re-wrote the code of  this assignment after it. 
A single-file python code which read files, combines them, remove stop words, devide lines randomly for train, test and validate sets and write them in 8 csv files in one main "for" loop used. Name of files are written in captions of the code. 
stopwords used are in textfile which is also available in this folder, and importe as a list in main code. 
since some of the output files were bigger than 25Mb limit, I uploaded in zip format.
Also I tried to use "git lf's" but I don't know why it doesn't work well for me. 
I think it is because  I am working on win 32 OS, I have some problems installing Git apps on my computer. I am working on it and fix it for my next assignment for sure.

Cheers
Hanif
